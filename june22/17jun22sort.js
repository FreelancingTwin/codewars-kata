For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0

2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1

10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.

let quikMafs = (a, b) => a - b;
let solution = arr =>
        arr.indexOf(arr.split().sort(quikMafs)[1])
